#RTC-Tac-Toe
A peer-to-peer Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in JavaScript using WebRTC and [Peer.js](http://peerjs.com/). 

Sometimes, it gets stuck while connecting to another peer. This only seems to occur with specific pairs of internet connections and manifests itself consistently on all applications using Peer.js, so it probably isn't a bug int RTC-Tac-Toe.
